# Poc5MinPwa

This quickly demonstrate how to enable PWA through Phoenix
## How does it work
All you need to do is [in this commit](https://github.com/NoBrainSkull/poc-5-min-PWA/commit/d5c01156aa1f7378d4bdedb8af56590755df446a).

## Test it on you machine:

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
  * Use [lighthouse extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk) to see if it is PWA-enabled

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
